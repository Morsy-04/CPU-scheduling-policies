# CPU Scheduling Policies Simulator

## üìã Project Overview
This project implements and visualizes several **CPU scheduling algorithms** using **C/C++**.  
It was developed for the **Operating Systems (CC373)** course at **Alexandria University, Faculty of Engineering**.

The simulator supports two operation modes:
- **Trace mode**: Displays a visual timeline of CPU scheduling.
- **Stats mode**: Outputs detailed scheduling statistics.

## üõ† Implemented Scheduling Algorithms
- **1. FCFS** (First Come First Serve)
- **2. RR** (Round Robin)
- **3. SPN** (Shortest Process Next)
- **4. SRT** (Shortest Remaining Time)
- **5. HRRN** (Highest Response Ratio Next)
- **6. FB-1** (Feedback Queue with quantum = 1)
- **7. FB-2i** (Feedback Queue with quantum = 2‚Å±)
- **8. Aging** (Priority-based with starvation prevention)

---

## üöÄ Features
- Input via **stdin**, output via **stdout**.
- **Strict output format** to match automated grading requirements.
- **Makefile** provided for easy compilation.
- **Optional**: **Dockerfile** provided for containerized builds.
- Support for **input redirection** and **piping**.
